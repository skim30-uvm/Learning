# Python Learning

This is a repository for python self-training.
Some of the contents are inspired, sourced, modifed from free study resources such as "https://pythoninstitute.org/free-python-courses/"
I tried my best effort to put reference or write my own code.

'ML' directory is for Machine Learning projects.
