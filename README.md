# Python Learning

This is a repository for python self-training.
Some of the contents are inspired, sourced, modifed from free study resources such as 
  - Python institute: https://pythoninstitute.org/free-python-courses/
  - Google Machine Learning Crash Course: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course
  - Google Machine Learning Practica https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica
  - Keras: https://keras.io/examples/
  - AWS training and certification https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/catalog

I tried my best efforts to put references or write my own code.

'ML' directory is for Machine Learning projects. 

ML/GAN_example is for Generative adversarial network projects.
